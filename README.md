# groovy-demos

This is a sample Groovy project that demonstrates the XML parsing using a groovy script.

The script file-handling.groovy contains logic to parse xml files which are present in a
particular folder and then writes the contents of the xml files in a csv file (books.csv).

The project is created using IntelliJ and so it can be cloned as a groovy project in IntelliJ.
